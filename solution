/*To solve this problem:

Using window function with the ability to control the rolling average window

1. The inner query of table A, sums the transactions and groups them by day (converting the timestamp to date).
2. The outer query with the window functions creates a rolling average for a window of 3 days.
3. Using the round function to display only two digits after the comma for the transactions for readability.
